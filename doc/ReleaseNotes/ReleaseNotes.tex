\section{Introduction}
This document describes MODFLOW~6 Version \modflowversion.  This distribution is packaged for personal computers using the Microsoft Windows 7 and 10 operating systems, although it may run on other versions of Windows.  The executable file was compiled for 64-bit Windows operating systems and should run on most personal computers.

Version numbers for MODFLOW~6 will follow a major.minor.revision format.  The major number will be increased when there are substantial new changes that may break backward compatibility.  The minor number will be increased when important, but relatively minor new functionality is added.  The revision number will be added when errors are corrected in either the program or input files.

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{History}
This section describes changes introduced into MODFLOW~6 for the current release.  Changes introduced in previous releases are in Appendix~\ref{app:A}. These changes may substantially affect users.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Version mf6.2.0--October 16, 2020

	\underline{NEW FUNCTIONALITY}
	\begin{itemize}
	        \item A new Buoyancy (BUY) Package for the Groundwater Flow (GWF) Model is introduced in this release as a way to represent variable-density groundwater flow.  The BUY Package is based on the hydraulic head formulation described by \cite{langevin2020hydraulic}.  The BUY Package in this release is considered preliminary.  Extensive testing of the BUY Package has been performed but changes to the code and input may be required in response to user needs and testing.   
		\item A new Groundwater Transport (GWT) Model is introduced in this release as a way to simulate the fate and transport of a dissolved solute.  The GWT Model in this release is considered preliminary.  Extensive testing of the GWT Model has been performed but changes to the code and input may be required in response to user needs and testing. 
		\item A preliminary release of the Basic Model Interface (BMI) was introduced in version 6.1.1.  The BMI released in this version is also considered preliminary (alpha release).  Limited testing of the BMI has been performed but significant changes are expected in future releases.  User support for the MODFLOW 6 BMI may be provided in the future.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\underline{EXAMPLES}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The format for the examples included in the distribution has changed.  The examples are now described in the modflow6-examples.pdf file in the doc folder.  The examples have been renamed, and they are no longer numbered.  Most of the examples are the same as those distributed with the previous release; however some have been modified, updated, combined or eliminated based on standardization of example construction, testing, and documentation.  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{\underline{BUG FIXES AND OTHER CHANGES TO EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY}} \\
	\underline{BASIC FUNCTIONALITY}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The observation routines were improved to handle very large numbers of observations written to the same comma-separated-value (CSV) file.  Non-advancing input-output is now used to write the CSV header instead of constructing a header string.   This change should substantially improve memory and runtime problems with models containing thousands of observations.
		\item If the CONTINUE option is specified in mfsim.nam, do not force models to write budget tables when the solver does not converge.  Instead, always use Output Control options to determine when budget tables are written if CONTINUE option is specified and the solver does not converge.  Also, if the CONTINUE option is specified, calculate and write observations even if the model does not converge.  Observations were being written as zero if the model did not converge, but the CONTINUE flag was set.
		\item Allow the program to read input files with very long lines.  Previously, the program was limited to a maximum line length of 50,000 characters.  The program now uses dynamic memory allocation, when necessary, to read any sized line in an input file.
	\end{itemize}

	\underline{STRESS PACKAGES}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
		\item 
		\item 
	\end{itemize}

	\underline{ADVANCED STRESS PACKAGES}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fix error in calculated Newton-Raphson MAW-GWF connection terms for the MAW Package. This correction should improve model convergence and may change existing model results. This correction does not affect simulations that use the FLOW\_CORRECTION option introduced in version 6.1.1.
		\item  The program will now terminate with an error message if the skin radius for a GWF connection in the MAW Package is less than or equal to the well radius. Warning messages are also issued when the well bottom, screen top for a GWF connection, or screen bottom for a GWF connection are reset by the program for one or more MAW Package wells.
		\item An SFR reach can have zero specified connections.  In this case, an entry is still required in the CONNECTIONDATA block for that reach.  The error check for this required entry was not implemented and so the program would continue with unexpected results.  The program now verifies that an entry is present in CONNECTIONDATA for every reach, even those with zero connections.
		\item If a GWF ``NONE'' connection was specified for SFR then the program would terminate with an error or proceed with unexpected results if GWF or SFR flow terms were written to binary output files.  The program was fixed so that GWF ``NONE'' connections for SFR are not written to the binary budget files.
		\item Increase the length of boundname to its intended size of 40 characters.  Boundnames were being truncated after 16 characters for the LAK, MAW, and SFR Packages.
	\end{itemize}

	\underline{SOLUTION}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A fix was implemented in the biconjugate gradient stabilized linear solver routine so that the maximum change in the dependent value is calculated and stored correctly.
		\item Corrected the SIMPLE and COOLEY under-relaxation schemes in the Iterative Model Solution (IMS).  The methods were not applying the correct under-relaxation factor.  The SIMPLE scheme now uses the user-specified value for gamma as the factor.  The COOLEY scheme updates the factor based on solver history.  
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Known Issues}
This section describes known issues with this release of MODFLOW~6.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
The AUXMULTNAME option can be used to scale input values, such as riverbed conductance, using values in an auxiliary column.  When this AUXMULTNAME option is used, the multiplier value in the AUXMULTNAME column should not be represented with a time series unless the value to scale is also represented with a time series.  

\item
The capability to use Unsaturated Zone Flow (UZF) routing beneath lakes and streams has not been implemented.

\end{enumerate}


% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Distribution File}
The following distribution file is for use on personal computers: \texttt{\modflowversion.zip}.  The distribution file is a compressed zip file. The following directory structure is incorporated in the zip file:

% folder structured created by python script
\input{folder_struct.tex}

It is recommended that no user files are kept in the \modflowversion~directory structure.  If you do plan to put your own files in the \modflowversion~directory structure, do so only by creating additional subdirectories.

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Installation and Execution}
There is no installation of MODFLOW~6 other than the requirement that \texttt{\modflowversion.zip} must be unzipped into a location where it can be accessed.  

To make the executable versions of MODFLOW~6 accessible from any directory, the directory containing the executables should be included in the PATH environment variable.  Also, if a prior release of MODFLOW~6 is installed on your system, the directory containing the executables for the prior release should be removed from the PATH environment variable.

As an alternative, the executable file, ``\texttt{mf6.exe}'', in the \modflowversion{}/bin directory can be copied into a directory already included in the PATH environment variable.

To run MODFLOW~6, simply type \texttt{mf6} in a terminal window.  The current working directory must be set to a location where the model input files are located.  Upon execution, MODFLOW~6 will immediately look for file with the name \texttt{mfsim.nam} in the current working directory, and will terminate with an error if it does not find this file.

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Compiling MODFLOW~6}
MODFLOW~6 has been compiled using Intel Visual Fortran and gfortran on the Windows and Mac/OS operating systems.  Because the program uses relatively new Fortran extensions, newer versions of the compilers may be required for successful compilation.  For example, to use gfortran to compile MODFLOW~6, gfortran version 4.9 or newer must be used.  If you have gfortran installed on your computer, you can tell which version it is by entering ``\verb|gfortran --version|'' at a terminal window.

This distribution contains the Microsoft Visual Studio solution and project files for compiling MODFLOW~6 on Windows using the Intel Fortran Compiler.  The files have been used successfully with Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 and Intel(R) Visual Fortran Compiler 2020.0.166.  To compile MODFLOW~6, open the mf6.sln file in the msvs folder and click Build >  Build Solution.  A separate Visual Studio solution file is also included for building the BMI dynamically linked library version of MODFLOW~6.

This distribution also comes with a makefile for compiling MODFLOW~6 with \texttt{gfortran}.  The makefile is contained in the \texttt{make} folder.

For those familiar with Python, the pymake package can also be used to compile MODFLOW~6.  Additional information on the Python pymake utility can be found at: \url{https://github.com/modflowpy/pymake}.  

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{System Requirements}
MODFLOW~6 is written in Fortran.  It uses features from the 95, 2003, and 2008 language.  The code has been used on UNIX-based computers and personal computers running various forms of the Microsoft Windows operating system.

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Testing}
The examples distributed with MODFLOW~6 can be run by navigating to the examples folder and executing the ``\texttt{run.bat}'' batch files within each example folder.  Alternatively, there is a ``\texttt{runall.bat}'' batch file under the examples folder that will run all of the test problems.

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{MODFLOW~6 Documentation}
Details on the numerical methods and the underlying theory for MODFLOW~6 are described in the following reports:

\begin{itemize}

\item \bibentry{modflow6framework}

\item \bibentry{modflow6gwf}

\item \bibentry{modflow6xt3d}
